# comfyui-mute-bypass-by-ID

These nodes were made with love for personal use, but if you like this node set? Feel free to buy me a coffee to keep me up late <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/pixelpainter">buymeacoffee/pixelpainter</a>

**12/29/2025**  in process
**Major Version Update V2.0.0**   
This will now reliably mute or bypass any node in any Subgraph using the Subgraph ID and Node ID together. Comfyui can sometimes assign a duplicate ID for nodes in different subgraphs, this latest update fixes this issue.

There are 4 nodes total:

**Node 1: Remote Mute Bypass Single**   

Use the Mode Select Button to change from Mute to Bypass\
Use the Active to Mute/Bypass switch to turn mute/bypass on and off

Click the dropdown and search by node ID or name, or select a subgraph and node to mute in the menu.

If you search by ID and you see 2 nodes with the same ID check the path for the Subgraph node you are looking for.

This node will take 2 Node ID's and will always mute/bypass 1 of the 2 ID's, you can switch mute/bypass between Node A or Node B
